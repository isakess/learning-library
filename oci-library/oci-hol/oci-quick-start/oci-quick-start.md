# OCI Quick Start Lab (VCN, Compute and Block Volume)

## Introduction

In this lab we will create a compute instance, install httpd server on it, attach block volume to it, and install an app on the Block Volume
We will then create a second compute instance using the boot volume of the first compute instance and move the Block Volume to the second compute instance (with the app installed).

### Objectives
- Demonstrate launching VCN

      </copy>
      ```

4. Enter command lsblk to verify the Block volume storage is initialized. This could be sda, sdb or somethig else strting with 'sd'. In below example this volume is called sdb. Below screen shot shows a 1 TB volume though in this lab we have created a 50GB volume thus the size in your compute instance will be 50GB.

      ```
      <copy>
      lsblk
      </copy>
      ```

     ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/OCI_Quick_Start001.PNG " ")

      **HINT:** The Name sdb is the block volume storage. This name could change for your specific attachment (i.e sdc).

5. To format the block volume, Enter Command: 

      ```
      <copy>
      bash            
      sudo fdisk <DEVICE_PATH> -l 
      </copy>
      ```
      **For example sudo fdisk /dev/sdb -l**   
      Wait for formatting to complete

6. Create a file system on the block volume, Enter Command: 

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      sudo mkfs.ext4 -L datapartition DEVICE_PATH
      </copy>
      ```  

      This will create the file system on the entire disk. Enter y when prompted with 'Proceed anyway'.

      **NOTE:** For this lab we will not be creating additional partitions.

7. Create a directory where the disk will be mounted,Enter commands:

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/www/html   
      </copy>         
      ```

8. Mount the disk to the newly created directory,
Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo mount  /dev/<VOLUME_NAME>  /mnt/www/html
      </copy>
      ```

9. Verify /dev/`<VOLUME_NAME>` volume is now mounted to /mnt/www/html directory, Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      lsblk 
      </copy>
      ```
      (in this case the volume is called sdc)

     ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/Customer_Lab_006.PNG " ")

10. Next we will download an app and install it. Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      cd /home/opc
      </copy>
      ```

11. Enter Command:

      ```
      <copy>
      unzip master.zip
      </copy>
      ```

13. Enter Command:
  
      ```
      <copy>
      sudo cp -R oci-quickstart-lab-master/static/* /mnt/www/html/
      </copy>
      ```

14. Modify httpd.conf file, Enter Command:
   
      ```
      <copy>
      sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf (for vi) 
      </copy>
      ```

      OR 

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo nano  /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  (for nano)
      </copy>
      ```

      **NOTE:** in vi you can save the file after modification by using Esc :wq 

15. Search for string /var/www and replace it with /mnt/www/html . This will be done in 3 locations

     ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/Customer_Lab_007.PNG " ")

16. Save and Exit (in vi user Esc :wq)

17. Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo chcon -R --type=httpd_sys_rw_content_t /mnt

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      http://COMPUTE_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
      </copy>
      ```

20. Screen like below should appear.

     ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/Customer_Lab_008.PNG " ")

We have initialized httpd.conf file. Next we will create a second compute instance using the boot volume of the first compute instance and attach Block Volume to it

## Step 5 (OPTIONAL): Detach the block volume and launch second compute instance using boot volume and attach Block Volume

In this section we will detach the block volume, Stop the compute instance, use its boot volume to launch a second compute instance and delete the second compute instance.

1. In ssh session to the compute instance unmount the directory from block volume, Enter command:

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      sudo umount /dev/<VOLUME_NAME> 
      </copy>
      ```
2. In OCI console window, Click your compute instance name and in **Attached Block Volume** section  Click the action icon and **Click Detach**.

3. Stop your compute instance by Clicking **Stop** in compute instance details page and then **OK** in Confirm window.

4. Once the instance is in Stopped state, Click **Boot Volume**, Click action icon and Click **Detach**. Click **OK** in Confirm window.

      **NOTE :** Boot Volume field is set to BOOT VOLUME and to the boot volume you detached from the original Instance.

      - **Instance Type**: Select Virtual Machine 
      - **Instance Shape**: Select VM shape 

      **Under Configure Networking**
      - **Virtual cloud network compartment**: Select your compartment
      - **Virtual cloud network**: Choose the VCN 
      - **Subnet Compartment:** Choose your compartment. 
      - **Subnet:** Choose the Public Subnet under **Public Subnets** 
      - **Use network security groups to control traffic** : Leave un-checked
      - **Assign a public IP address**: Check this option

      - **Boot Volume:** Leave the default
      - **Add SSH Keys:** Choose 'Paste SSH Keys' and paste the Public Key saved earlier.

8. Click **Create**.

   **NOTE:** If 'Service limit' error is displayed choose a different shape such as VM.Standard.E2.2 OR VM.Standard2.2 OR Choose a different AD.

9. Once the instance is in Running state, attach the block volume to this new instance using OCI Console.**Ensure to use Paravirtualized mode.**

10. ssh to compute instance and mount the block volume as before, Enter Command:

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      sudo mount  /dev/<VOLUME_NAME>  /mnt/www/html
      </copy>
      ```

11. Restart httpd, Enter command

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo systemctl restart httpd
      </copy>
      ```

12. Launch a web browser and Enter compute Instance's public IP, **`http://<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>`**

13. Screen like below should appear, Enter the required information.

     ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/Customer_Lab_015.PNG " ")

We have now successfully launched a compute instance using another instance's boot volume and re-attached a block volume that was attached to another instance. The block volume preserved all the data on it during this process. Moreover the compute instance launched using the boot volume had httpd server and fire wall configuration already present.
